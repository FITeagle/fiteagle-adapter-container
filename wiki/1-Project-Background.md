## FITeagle
The FITeagle system provides a large, flexible and well described environment for internet testbeds. These testbeds exist to evolve existing mechanism of the internet and to test and develop new ideas of the future internet. Many insitutions started to set up their own testbeds and used different protocols to do so but since the internet spans over the entire world it is desirable to connect these. The FITeagle system tries to connect these with its federation mechanism and a set of standardized mechanisms and protocols. The federation mechanism of the FITeagle system has interfaces that can speak the different protocols of the many connected systems enabling larger test and experiments. FITeagle iself has been deveolped by a working group at the AV chair of TU Berlin. It was implemented during a project by Franco Hermann, Volker Jung and Leonhard Palm.

## Docker
Docker is a Lightweight Virtualization Solution developed as an open source project and managed by Docker, Inc. Docker was started by dotCloud, Inc. in March 2013 (the first github commit) as the deployment engine which ran their dotCloud PaaS software. In October 2013 dotCloud, Inc changed its name to Docker, Inc., and later on in 2014 it sold its dotCloud PaaS, to focus solemnly on Docker. Docker is a tool to build, run and manage containers, Docker Inc. is also providing the Docker Hub which is a registry for container images.
With the release of Version 0.9 Docker no longer uses the LXC library as the default execution environment. The new library behind Docker is libcontainer which provides direct access for Docker to Linux kernel features
libcontainer is written in Google's Go programming language and is aspiring to standardize making
containers. With this unified library it is easier for application developers to create containerized applications.
libcontainer is an open source collaboration of different companies such as Red Hat, Google and of course Docker who are cooperating to develop an important component of containerization. It was first started under the Docker roof but then given to the Open Container Initiative(OCI) â€“ which was back then the Open Container Project but since there was a name conflict with Open Compute Project it changed - to be developed further as an open library. OCI tries to harmonize container-formats and engines.
Docker exposes a very clear HTTP API,  most of the API tends to be REST with a few exception that take over the HTTP connection to transport stdin, stdout and stderr. Per default the Docker daemon listens on unix:///var/run/docker.sock but can be configured to listen on any given host/port no matter if tcp or unix socket. This makes it quite easy and comfortable to manage Docker remotely.

## Semantic Description
One of the important aspects of the FITeagle system are the federation mechanisms, so that the system can incorporate many different institutions, testbeds and protocols in order to do that the system must be protocol independent. A semantic description model was proposed, to simplify protocol handovers when working on identical resources. This does not only interoperability but also allows special algorithms to reason over messages and resources.
Using RDF, RDFS and OWL a semantic descriptions for the system and its resources has been established.
